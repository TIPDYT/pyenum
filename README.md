# pyenun (Python Enumeration)
by TIPDYT
## What is pyenun?
It is a library that adds enumeration to Python
It's like any other programming languages.
## What's the syntax?
Example:
```progrlang = enum(["C", "Python", "Ruby", "Swift", "Java", "JavaScript", "Scala", "Perl"])``

Now you can use it in if statements

```
cur = "Ruby"
if cur == progrlang.Ruby:
     print("It's Ruby")
```

## Can I create multiple enums?

Yes you can with the same syntax.

## How it works?

It's a class called enum and it 
has a class constructor which requires the values.
Then it gets the length and adds to self each value.
